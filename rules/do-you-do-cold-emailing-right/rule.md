You write a “perfect” cold email, hit send… and get silence. So you push harder: longer copy, bigger claims, a calendar link. Still nothing. The problem isn’t that email “doesn’t work”—it’s that you aimed at the wrong target. The goal of a cold email is **not** to pitch, demo, or close. The goal is a **reply** that starts a buying conversation. Aim for *a response*, and your subject lines, body, and CTAs all get sharper—and your pipeline gets healthier.  

<!--endintro-->

## The mindset: replies over meetings

**Don’t aim for:** ❌ value dump ❌ demo request ❌ “15–30 mins on your calendar?” ❌\
**Do aim for:** a short, relevant note that earns a quick “yes,” “no,” or “tell me more.”

## Personalization + relevance (by lead tier)

Not every prospect deserves the same effort. Tier your list and match your personalization.

| **1** | High-value ICP, decision-makers | 1:1 research     | Mutual context, interests, timely initiatives, intent            |
| **2** | Good-fit ICP                    | Semi-automated   | Industry pain, recent triggers (funding, hiring, tech, location) |
| **3** | Everyone else                   | Mostly automated | First name, company, role-based pains                            |

## Anatomy of a cold email that gets replies

1. **Subject:** pattern interruption that only makes sense to *them*.  
2. **Opener:** one line proving you did your homework.  
3. **Value:** *their* problem, *your* specific benefit (no feature dump).  
4. **CTA:** one soft, easy question (no calendar yet).  
5. **Length:** ≤100 words for T2/3; T1 can be longer if it’s truly personal.  
6. **Tone:** human, plain English, zero fluff.

**SUBJECT:** question about your loyalty program

Hi Jim,

**OPENER:** Just saw on LinkedIn that your team at Pilot/Flying J is hiring for a new loyalty marketing manager — congrats on the growth.

**VALUE:** Usually when companies expand that team, it means they're struggling to keep their massive customer base engaged beyond the point of sale. It's a huge challenge to make each of your 1.5 million daily visitors feel like an individual.

We recently helped a similar multi-location brand, \[Lesser Competitor Name], boost their repeat customer visits by 15% in one quarter by implementing a targeted digital coupon strategy.

**CTA:** Do you have 15 minutes next week to chat about how you're approaching this? Might be able to share a few ideas that have worked for others.

Cheers,

Josh

## Write it (with examples)

### Tier 1 (hyper-personalized 1:1)

::: greybox
Subject: Zurich + Le Dip cheeseburger + {{Your Company}}

Hi Sam — your post on 🇨🇭 roots + that Le Dip burger made me smile.\
Noticed you’re hiring 3 CSMs while launching in EU. Teams I help cut onboarding time ~30% by unifying playbooks and usage data.

Worth a quick reply if “faster ramp before Q4” is on your list? If not, I’ll leave you in peace.

### Tier 2/3 (short, segmented)

::: greybox
Subject: For {{Company}}’s printing leads

Hi {{FirstName}}, printing services often lose local search traffic to aggregators.\
We’ve helped peers lift inbound quotes 10–20% by fixing GMB + service pages.

Open to a quick reply if local visibility is a 2025 focus for you?

## The 3-email sequence that works

### 1) The personalized introduction

Use one of the templates above. End with a single question.

### 2) The follow-up (reply in-thread)

Keep it to one line. No “just checking in.”

Hi {{FirstName}} — curious if “faster ramp before Q4” is on the list?

### 3) The breakup (pattern interruption + give an out)

Re-state value → playful P.S. → permission to say “no.”

::: greybox
If speeding up onboarding isn’t a priority this quarter, happy to close the loop.\
P.S. If a woman named Francine asks about me on Aruba… tell her I care, but it’ll never work. I’ll explain later. 🙂

## Keep it human (AI is co-pilot, not autopilot)

AI can help you brainstorm variants, but raw AI copy reads… like AI. Use it to draft, then **humanize**: add one real detail, cut flab, end with a question.

![Figure: - Personalization lifts purchase, recommendation, and repurchase likelihood (McKinsey)](/mnt/data/imgi_71_image.png)

## Do’s and Don’ts

**Do**

* Research first; write second (especially for Tier 1)  
* Lead with *their* problem and outcome  
* Ask one question; make “no” easy  
* A/B test subject lines, hooks, and questions  
* Pair email with calls/LinkedIn/video for lift

**Don’t**

* Paste your pitch deck into an email  
* Ask for 30 minutes from a stranger  
* Write walls of text or multiple CTAs  
* Over-automate without segmenting  
* Send without checking: “Would *I* reply to this?”

## Quick checklist (before you send)

* Subject makes sense only to the recipient  
* <100 words (T2/3), one problem, one outcome  
* Specific social proof or result (optional but strong)  
* One soft question (no calendar link)  
* You’d feel comfortable receiving it yourself

By treating every cold email like a ticket to a conversation—not a meeting request—you’ll write shorter, sharper notes that people actually answer. Then keep the momentum with a tight follow-up and a memorable breakup email.
