You write a “perfect” cold email, hit send… and get silence. So you push harder: longer copy, bigger claims, a calendar link. Still nothing. The problem isn’t that email “doesn’t work”—it’s that you aimed at the wrong target. The goal of a cold email is **not** to pitch, demo, or close. The goal is a **reply** that starts a buying conversation. Aim for *a response*, and your subject lines, body, and CTAs all get sharper—and your pipeline gets healthier.  
<!--endintro-->

## The mindset: replies over meetings
**Don’t aim for:** value dump ❌ · demo request ❌ · “15–30 mins on your calendar?” ❌  
**Do aim for:** a short, relevant note that earns a quick “yes,” “no,” or “tell me more.”

## Personalization + relevance (by lead tier)
Not every prospect deserves the same effort. Tier your list and match your personalization.

| Tier | Who | Effort | Personalization focus |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **1** | High-value ICP, decision-makers | 1:1 research | Mutual context, interests, timely initiatives, intent |
| **2** | Good-fit ICP | Semi-automated | Industry pain, recent triggers (funding, hiring, tech, location) |
| **3** | Everyone else | Mostly automated | First name, company, role-based pains |

## Anatomy of a cold email that gets replies
1. **Subject:** pattern interruption that only makes sense to *them*.  
2. **Opener:** one line proving you did your homework.  
3. **Value:** *their* problem, *your* specific benefit (no feature dump).  
4. **CTA:** one soft, easy question (no calendar yet).  
5. **Length:** ≤100 words for T2/3; T1 can be longer if it’s truly personal.  
6. **Tone:** human, plain English, zero fluff.

## Write it (with examples)

### Tier 1 (hyper-personalized 1:1)
::: greybox
Subject: Zurich + Le Dip cheeseburger + {{Your Company}}

Hi Sam — your post on 🇨🇭 roots + that Le Dip burger made me smile.  
Noticed you’re hiring 3 CSMs while launching in EU. Teams I help cut onboarding time ~30% by unifying playbooks and usage data.

Worth a quick reply if “faster ramp before Q4” is on your list? If not, I’ll leave you in peace.

### Tier 2/3 (short, segmented)
::: greybox
Subject: For {{Company}}’s printing leads

Hi {{FirstName}}, printing services often lose local search traffic to aggregators.  
We’ve helped peers lift inbound quotes 10–20% by fixing GMB + service pages.

Open to a quick reply if local visibility is a 2025 focus for you?

## The 3-email sequence that works

### 1) The personalized introduction  
Use one of the templates above. End with a single question.

### 2) The follow-up (reply in-thread)
Keep it to one line. No “just checking in.”

::: greybox
Hi {{FirstName}} — curious if “faster ramp before Q4” is on the list?

### 3) The breakup (pattern interruption + give an out)
Re-state value → playful P.S. → permission to say “no.”

::: greybox
If speeding up onboarding isn’t a priority this quarter, happy to close the loop.  
P.S. If a woman named Francine asks about me on Aruba… tell her I care, but it’ll never work. I’ll explain later. 🙂

## Keep it human (AI is co-pilot, not autopilot)
AI can help you brainstorm variants, but raw AI copy reads… like AI. Use it to draft, then **humanize**: add one real detail, cut flab, end with a question.

## Do’s and Don’ts
**Do**
* Research first; write second (especially for Tier 1)  
* Lead with *their* problem and outcome  
* Ask one question; make “no” easy  
* A/B test subject lines, hooks, and questions  
* Pair email with calls/LinkedIn/video for lift

**Don’t**
* Paste your pitch deck into an email  
* Ask for 30 minutes from a stranger  
* Write walls of text or multiple CTAs  
* Over-automate without segmenting  
* Send without checking: “Would *I* reply to this?”

## Quick checklist (before you send)
- Subject makes sense only to the recipient  
- <100 words (T2/3), one problem, one outcome  
- Specific social proof or result (optional but strong)  
- One soft question (no calendar link)  
- You’d feel comfortable receiving it yourself

By treating every cold email like a ticket to a conversation—not a meeting request—you’ll write shorter, sharper notes that people actually answer. Then keep the momentum with a tight follow-up and a memorable breakup email.
